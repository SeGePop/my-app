    Hello! My name is Sergiu George Pop and welcome to my website!
    I am a web developer based in Bihor County, Romania. My passion lies in building everything from small business sites to rich interactive web apps. If you are a business seeking a web presence or an employer, please feel free to get in touch with me via the Contact section or by clicking on my personal e-mail address at the bottom.
    
    Prior to my career in web development, I spent 10 years working as a mechanical engineer. During this time, I gained extensive experience in both 2D and 3D design, was delegated for months at a time abroad, and managed a 3-month-long project coordinating up to 10 people. However, I have always been passionate about programming and software development, which has led me to pursue a career in web development.</p>
